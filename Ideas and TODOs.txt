WTF is an ABI?
    * What is an ABI?
    * When does ABI become a problem?
        * ABI mismatch can cause explosions!
        * Hard to improve code once it is in the wild.
    * Example of real-world ABI breakages causing problems.
    * Why is it so brittle in C++?
    * How can we avoid ABI problems?
        * Compile everything from source.
            * Ideal in theory, not always applicable in practice.
            * Not an option in many domains where implementation is secret.
        * Change the way you write your code.
            * Don't ship APIs with types you don't control.
            * ABI version check as part of API.
            * C APIs
                * Hourglass APIs
            * Opaque pointers (PImpl idiom)
            * Header-only libraries
                * True Header-Only
                * STB-style
    * Conclusion
        * Pick your poison. All options stink, but some may stink less
        for your specific use case.
        * ABI is not a boogeyman, but it is here to stay.
