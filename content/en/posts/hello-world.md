## Screaming into the void.

Hi! I'm Stuart. Welcome to my new blog, where I will rant and rave about systems programming and other nonsense. Lately I've been trying to get caught up on next-gen graphics APIs, so a lot of my toy projects and experiments have been based around Vulkan and SPIR-V. I may also post about my hobbies and personal life, including game development, music and my cats!

Thanks for stopping by!
