## Curiosity killed the cat

![Example image](/violence.png)

Are you a C++ student? Do you want to explore all the vile Lovecraftian horrors that lie just beneath the surface? If you'd like to take that first brave step into the abyss, you're in luck. I'm starting a series of articles called **_WTF is this?_** where I will expose newer programmers to the gritty, hair-raising monstrosities that I wish I had learned sooner.

When I was a student, I felt like there weren't a lot of resources out there that approached technical problems in a conversational, non-academic way. Personally, I learn best by getting my hands dirty, breaking things, and exchanging horror stories with my friends and colleagues. So, in this series I want to start deconstructing concepts that I really struggled to get my head around when I was studying. Some of my ideas include:

* WTF is an ABI?
* WTF is Dynamic Memory Allocation?
* WTF are Custom Allocators?
* WTF is Template Metaprogramming?
* WTF is Vulkan?

<br/>

I think it could be really fun. Each article will introduce the concept, show some practical examples, and leave you with some more reading if you feel like digging into the concept further. The first one I would like to tackle is **_WTF is an ABI_**, this is a hot issue in the C++ community and it is one that has personally screwed me a few times now. Obviously like any good blog, I have no idea how often I can work on these. It'll be out when it's out‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.

Ta ta for now.
