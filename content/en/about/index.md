## New blog, who dis? ##

Hello, my name is Stuart Adams. Welcome to my blog! I work at Codeplay Software as a Staff Software Engineer. I am a graduate of the University of the West of Scotland, where I studied Computer Games Technology. My main interests in programming are GPUs, graphics, and high-performance computing. I enjoy learning new low-level system APIs and using them to build cool tools and applications.

In my spare time I like to play games, develop games, write music and read. I recently started learning Japanese. Maybe if I get good enough I'll start writing about my learning experiences.

## What is a "nyalloc"? ## 

In Japanese, nya にゃ, means "meow". I combined this with the C library function **malloc** to create **nyalloc**, a name that combines my love for code, cats, and Japanese pop culture.
